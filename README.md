## Custom Function for Python describe() method in Excel using VBA

Python has a very good method, it goes by the name describe(). When operated on a numerical data, it gives following statistical output:
1. Unique Counts
2. Mean
3. Min
4. 25% percentile
5. Median
6. 75% percentile
7. Max

I have created a custom function in Excel using VBA named "DESCRIBE" that gives the same output as describe().
